// raxis-store::table — Canonical DDL table name enum.
// Normative reference: kernel-store.md §2.5.1 "Canonical DDL Parts 1–4".
// Rules:
//   - Every SQL string that references a table MUST use `Table::X.as_str()`
//     rather than a raw string literal. This ensures a single point of truth
//     for table names; a rename in the DDL requires only one code change here.
//   - `as_str()` returns the exact string used in the migration DDL and must
//     stay in bijection with it. The unit test `all_variants_have_nonempty_str`
//     guards against empty returns.
//   - This enum is not serialized over the wire; it is a compile-time constant.
// ── Invariant: kernel.db never stores credential VALUES ───────────────────
// `kernel.db` is the kernel's metadata store. It records WHICH credentials
// each task wants bound (see `Table::TaskCredentialProxies`) but it never
// records the credential bytes themselves. Bytes — postgres URLs with
// passwords, bearer tokens, kubeconfig YAML, SMTP passwords, etc. — live
// behind the `CredentialBackend` trait (the reference `FileCredentialBackend`
// stores them with `0600` perms in `~/.config/raxis/credentials/<name>.env`;
// production deployments may swap in `VaultBackend`,
// `AwsSecretsManagerBackend`, `Pkcs11HsmBackend`, etc. — see
// `extensibility-traits.md §4`).
// Adding a column or table that would persist a credential VALUE is
// forbidden by `credential-proxy.md §1.1`. Reviewers MUST reject such a
// change.

/// All kernel.db tables. v1 baseline = 19 tables (kernel-store.md §2.5.1
/// migration 1); v1.x extensions append below.
